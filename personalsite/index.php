			<p>Mechanical is a demonstration site that sells computer peripherals such as keyboards and mice. This site makes use of an "origami" style design, with elements and graphics being stylized after layered or folded paper. After all, typing on a keyboard should be as easy as writing on paper.	This demo focuses on PHP integration, with features such as a search engine, JSON category sorting, and dynamic product pages.

			<p>Zephyr is a demonstration site that acts as a search engine for realty listings. By typing in an address, city, or ZIP code, you are presented results in a clean and easy to understand manner.	This demo focuses on the use of fullPage.js, a plugin that creates "slides" to replace scrolling on a webpage. This demo is not attached to any official realty search engines, and as a result, does not actually search for homes. The site just contains a few examples of what each listing would look like.

			<p>Polo Grounds Baseball is a site developed for a client who needed a website for his fantasy baseball league. Polo Grounds uses statistics from MLB players to determine results of simulated games. Simon had to create a site that would manage 900+ players, 24 teams, blog posts, and more, without overloading the user with information. This site is currently in the process of launching, but is fully functional.
