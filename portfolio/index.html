                                KEJI started as a prototype Simon created in Phaser to test an idea that he had - a platformer where the level could change based on the web browser's size. In this project, Simon worked on pretty much everything. He created the player sprites and a handful of objects and environmental sprites, but soon switched to programming. The game features six levels, an interactive start and win screen, text tutorials, and original music and sound effects. Winner of best gameplay at the Stout Game Expo (SGX) in 2020.

                                The level designs would rely on resizing the browser window to modify the level in order to proceed. In the level shown above, the player will easily be able to push the ice cube down to the heater to unlock the exit, but getting back up isn't possible without making the window smaller vertically in order to reach the exit.

                                Simon also created all of the music and sound effects using BeepBox. The SFX were carefully chosen to provide player feedback without being annoying. During playtesting, the group noted that the playtesters found the game satisfying, and Simon believes that the difficulty of mastering the resizing mechanic combined with the positive SFX contribute to that effect.

                            <h1>Runoff</h1>
                            <p>
                                Runoff is a board game centered around the environmental threat of runoff. Players have to strategize the expansion of their city by balancing power production and pollution. Adding buildings to your city provides victory points to determine the winner at the end of the game. However, if too much pollution reaches the river, both players immediately lose. The game features a hand crafted wooden board, laser cut wooden pieces, and printed event cards and rulebooks. This game was brought to Protospiel Minnesota in 2018, and was shown in the Best of Design show at Stout in 2019.

                                The event cards were one of Simon's contributions to this project. They provide an element of randomness for players to be surprised by. Some events would be positive, and others would be negative. The cards were printed and hand cut. Simon also designed the poster shown below, the rulebook, and business cards that were used at Protospiel.

                                The back side of the rulebook (left) provides information about runoff and pollution. There are polluted water sources within Menomonie that were caused by runoff, and the group wanted this game to have an educational component that addressed the inspiration for the game. The artwork on the front side of the rulebook (right) was used as the promotional poster for the game at the Stout Game Expo (SGX).

                            <p>
                                Waltz of the Thief is an Android game created using Unity. Simon was a member of the small group that created the game. He created the majority of the sprites in the game, along with the level designs. Waltz of the Thief is a stealth game where every character moves at the same time as the player. The player has to predict guard patrols in order to avoid being seen, while also finding the key to the exit door that brings them to the next level. The game features four levels and a tutorial stage, four enemy types, and many NPCs with items to pickpocket.

                                Throughout the course of the game's development, Simon created unique tilesets for each level. To demonstrate the use of the tiles, he created demos that show how the tiles can be used in a level. This demo is for the library, the third level in the game. It shows the player sprite idle animation, fireplace and portrait sprites for decoration, and floor and wall sprites to construct the level.

                                This is another demo of a tileset used in the last level of the game, the attic. This demo also includes the HUD elements used for controlling the player, along with the settings gear. The centerpiece of the attic level is the stained glass window shown in the center, which provides a dramatic exit for the player as they crash out of the window to escape the mansion.

                                Simon worked as part of a small team to develop a web game for a client, T-Rex Cookie. The game was developed in roughly 3 weeks, which limited the complexity of the project. T-Rex Cookie Rescue is an infinite runner where the player is a cookie trying to escape being squashed by a T-Rex baker. Within the project, Simon created vector assets for use within Unity, added animations and polish, as well as programming a handful of features into the game.

                            <p>
                                In his senior year, Simon began working for the UW Stout Manufacturing Outreach Center to develop a lean manufacturing training simulation. The simulation targeted Android tablets, and would be a multi-player experience created in Unity. Due to licensing restrictions at the university, Simon had to learn open-source software, such as Blender and ArmorPaint, for the creation of the 3D assets.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The simulation involved constructing an object with multiple parts, so the canister was created to be able to be easily broken down into multiple pieces. The canister object was loosely themed around sci-fi electronics. Each part was modeled individually to offer precise construction. Simon was able to practice using Blender, and developed better topology skills along with being exposed to new tools.

                                The simulation also needed a backdrop for the canister objects to be assembled in front of, so background models were created to add to the scene. The models were created in Blender, textured in ArmorPaint, and imported into Unity.

                                The Fool is an interactive experience that demonstrates 3D techniques using Unreal Engine. The project prompt was a provided tarot card, and Simon drew The Fool. To reflect this, he wanted to create an experience that emphasized the unknown. Simon worked heavily with lighting and sound to create the mysterious, unsettling atmosphere shown in the walkthrough video above.

                                This portal lights up at the end of the experience when all four gems have been found. This portal acts as a center hub for the experience, as the pathways surround and converge onto this point. The lighting changes dramatically when the portal is active, which makes the cave much less oppressive. This reflects a turning point in the fool's journey, as you would see in a tarot deck.

                                This is one of the modular assets created for use in the experience. The wall mesh was made to be repeated horizontally with no seams. Using Unreal, a blueprint was created to add rocks surrounding the base to break the transition between the floor and wall.

                                This was a group project to model and animate a section of a street. Simon arranged the scene with all of the assets that were created, rigged and animated the hooded figure walking towards the camera, modeled the bridge and street, and edited the final video of the project.

                                This was a project that involved designing a robot based on a verb prompt. Simon received the word "kick", and thought of the robots used in the RoboCup. He started with a 2D turnaround of the design before creating it in Maya.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Simon wanted the design to be playful and modern, and not aggressive or threatening in any way. The small arms would just be used for balance and right itself if the robot fell over. The design suggests modularity, as if the entire thing could be disassembled and reassembled easily. This could be for maintenance, or to switch out the small arms for larger ones if the robot was acting as the goalie.
                            </p>

                                The model translated the same ideas Simon had from above into 3D space. He created a basic ball model to assist, but ended up refining it with an improved concept for the animated video.

                                During his time working with Blue Devil Productions, he was tasked with redesigning their website. Their previous site hadn't been updated in 10 years, and was becoming challenging to maintain. The site now features a new layout, cleaner design, mobile friendly version, and easier navigation to important resources.

                                The interior pages retain a similar layout for clarity, and aim to provide information clearly and efficiently. A focus of the redesign was to create a hierarchy so that the most important information would be viewed first. On the homepage, this would be the slideshow that features the next upcoming events. The blog section of the site was also revisited to be much easier to browse, and also allows for long-form articles to be included as part of BDP's social media presence.

                                For this project, Simon was tasked with creating an event poster. The National Reuse Conference is a fictional event created for use in this project. Simon wanted to make a poster centered around sustainability, and the idea of reuse ties into the transformation of the bottle into a lightbulb. Simon had previously been studying Paula Scher and her use of typography, and decided to incorporate Scher's method of type-as-image into his own style.

                                Simon was asked to create a website for Minneapolis Community & Technical College's Apparel Design graduate show. The year's title for the show was Soul Assemblage. Simon created a site that featured their work and provided details for their senior show. The website was developed as a custom Wordpress theme, and each graduate had a full bio and multiple pictures attached to them.

                                This project was aimed at performing user research for a food mobile app. Simon chose Erbert & Gerbert's, and decided to focus on streamlining the ordering process. To start, a basic usability evaluation was done, followed by a competitive analysis for three other similar apps.

                                User research was then performed for the app. Due to COVID-19, in-person interviews were limited. To compensate for a lack of data in this area, an online survey was conducted as well as researching app store reviews for common complaints. Observations taken from the research were grouped into an affinity map, and used to create a prioritization matrix and user personas.
                            </p>

                                Once all the data was gathered, Simon created a new design in the form of a lo-fi paper prototype and tested it with a few users. Most users provided testing over a video call. The prototype proved to be successful, and limited confusion in the areas that users were struggling in the app.
